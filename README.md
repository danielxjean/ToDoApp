#ToDoApp
======
This repository was used for my first react application called the ToDoApp


Project Description
=======

Objective 
------
Develop a simple application that uses React, a language that I am learning, to make an app for a ToDo list. This app allows adding in a text input field a task, and upon pressing the Submit button or the Enter key, it automatically adds to the list of things to do and if the user clicks on the task, it deletes that task from the screen, thus considering it done.
